## ÂµOS++ complementary C library functions

These are some files that complement or extend the C library:

- `c-syscalls-empty.c` define weak empty syscalls to keep the linker happy; redefine those needed for retargeted configurations;
- `_sbrk.c` allocates block of memory in the free store (the heap) at the end of RAM, up to the stack; must match the definitons in the linker script;
- `stdlib/assert.c` defines the function to be called when assertions are taken;
- `stdlib/atexit.cpp` defines a simple registry for functions to be called when the program is terminated; useful for semihosting applications that terminate normally; the size of the static array is `OS_INTEGER_ATEXIT_ARRAY_SIZE`, default 3;
- `stdlib/exit.c` defines the functionality of `exit()` and `abort()`
- `stdlib/init-fini.c` defines weak empty `_init()` and `_fini()`, to keep linker happy.

## Developer info

This section is intended to developers who plan to include this library in their own projects.

### Easy install

The source files are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/c-libs):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/micro-os-plus/c-libs.git c-libs.git
```

The library will shortly be available from the npm registry:

```bash
$ npm install @micro-os-plus/c-libs
```

### Prerequisites

The source code require a modern C++ compiler, preferably GCC 5 or higher, but was also compiled with GCC 4.8.
